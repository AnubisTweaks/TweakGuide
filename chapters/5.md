# Chapter 5: Logos

Logos helps us developers hook, group and initialize parts of code, that would normally require a lot more code to write. I will show the basics of it, but a better detailed guide of Logos can be found [here](https://iphonedevwiki.net/index.php/Logos). 

## Hooks

You may have heard the term hooking before. This is what tweaks do. iOS is written mainly in Objective-C, and this allows us with the help of substrate/substitute to override values and change/add to the code that is already run. 

This is how hooks are done using Theos' Logos. ```%hook``` followed by the name of a [class](). When hooking a class, you must always end it with a corresponding ```%end```. This just tells Theos you are done with that class. When hooking something, I start by typing a ```%hook``` followed by three new lines and ending with a ```%end```.

```objective-c
%hook ClassName

- (void)method;

%end
```
