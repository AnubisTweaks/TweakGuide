# Chapter 1: Installing Theos

Theos is a build system to help developers make tweaks easier. It was built to work on most systems, and uses [Logos](https://iphonedevwiki.net/index.php/Logos) to make hooking iOS much easier. 

In order to write your tweaks, you must have a text editor. While most built in editors will work, a editor that is built for writing code will make your life so much easier. This tutorial will be using Visual Studio Code (VSCode), but that is totally your choice. I chose VSCode because of its support for Objective-C syntax highlighting and built in terminal window, and works on Mac, Linux and Windows. A list of popular editors are linked below
