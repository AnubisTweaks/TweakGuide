# Chapter 1: Installing Theos & Configuring Your Environment

Theos is a build system to help developers make tweaks easier. It was built to work on most systems, and uses [Logos](https://iphonedevwiki.net/index.php/Logos) to make hooking iOS much easier. 

In order to write your tweaks, you must have a text editor. While most built in editors will work, a editor that is built for writing code will make your life so much easier. This tutorial will be using Visual Studio Code (VSCode), but that is totally your choice. I chose VSCode because of its support for Objective-C syntax highlighting and built in terminal window, and works on Mac, Linux and Windows. A list of popular editors are linked below

# Terminal

A terminal is required to build, debug and install tweaks. Despite my Mac having Terminal installed by default, I also suggest another app such as [iTerm 2](https://www.iterm2.com/). For Linux, you can find a terminal simply by searching for it in your operating system's search function. 

On Mac and Linux systems, each user has a specific file that allows for the customization of the terminal. Since I use ZSH as my shell, mine is located at ```~/.zshrc``` with the ```~``` representing my home folder ```/Users/mtac/```

I have set up some terminal shortcuts to help with the building and writing of tweaks. Below is a snippet of my ```~/.zshrc``` and I highly suggest you add them to your terminal configuration file to help with typing the same commands over and over.

```bash
alias c="clear"
alias tweak="$THEOS/bin/nic.pl"
