# Chapter 1: Installing Theos & Configuring Your Environment

Theos is a build system to help developers make tweaks easier. It was built to work on most systems, and uses [Logos](https://iphonedevwiki.net/index.php/Logos) to make hooking iOS much easier. 

In order to write your tweaks, you must have a text editor. While most built in editors will work, a editor that is built for writing code will make your life so much easier. This tutorial will be using Visual Studio Code (VSCode), but that is totally your choice. I chose VSCode because of its support for Objective-C syntax highlighting and built in terminal window, and works on Mac, Linux and Windows. A list of popular editors are linked below

* [Atom](https://atom.io/)
* [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/3)

# Terminal

A terminal is required to build, debug and install tweaks. Despite my Mac having Terminal installed by default, I also suggest another app such as [iTerm 2](https://www.iterm2.com/). For Linux, you can find a terminal simply by searching for it in your operating system's search function. 

On Mac and Linux systems, each user has a specific file that allows for the customization of the terminal. Since I use ZSH as my shell, mine is located at ```~/.zshrc``` with the ```~``` representing my home folder ```/Users/mtac/```

I have set up some terminal shortcuts to help with the building and writing of tweaks. Below is a snippet of my ```~/.zshrc``` and I highly suggest you add them to your terminal configuration file to help with typing the same commands over and over.

```bash
alias c="clear"
alias tweak="$THEOS/bin/nic.pl"
alias tweaks="cd ~/Documents/Tweaks"
alias install="find . -name '.DS_Store' -type f -delete; make clean; make package install"
```

This way when you type the word following ```alias``` your system will run the command inside the quotation marks, saving time. Here ```c``` stands for the command ```clear``` which clears the current terminal window of all previous output, ```tweak``` displays Theos' templates for a new tweak, ```tweaks``` changes the current working directory to the folder where all your tweaks are stored, and ```install``` removes unnecessary hidden files, cleans the build and installs it to your device. Note that this is built for macOS, and ```find . -name '.DS_Store' -type f -delete``` will not work on Linux. You can use these aliases to make shortcuts to commands for anything you like!

# Installing Theos

A full detailed guide is available [here](https://github.com/theos/theos/wiki/Installation) from the official Theos GitHub page. I will go over an installation on macOS here however.

There are a few requirements that you must install before using Theos to build tweaks. First install [Xcode](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12) from the Mac AppStore. Once this is installed, run the following code inside your terminal to install the required Command Line Tools

```xcode-select --install```

![xcode-select](https://github.com/MTACS/TweakGuide/blob/master/images/xcode-select.png)

This will pop up a window, and it may take a few minutes for it to install. Next we will install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) which is a package manager for macOS to help install the required dependencies. Install it by running the following command inside your terminal

```/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"```

![homebrew](https://github.com/MTACS/TweakGuide/blob/master/images/brew.png)

Packages can be installed by running ```brew``` followed by the name of the package. To install these dependencies run the following command inside a terminal

```brew install ldid xz```

![dependencies](https://github.com/MTACS/TweakGuide/blob/master/images/dependencies.png)

Next we will set the directory to where your Theos installation will be stored. For me I always install it to my home directory ```~``` to make navigating to it much easier. Run the following command, changing ```~/theos``` to the folder of your choosing

```echo "export THEOS=~/theos" >> ~/.zshrc``` for macOS 10.15 and newer

```echo "export THEOS=~/theos" >> ~/.profile``` for macOS 10.14 and older

![set-theos](https://github.com/MTACS/TweakGuide/blob/master/images/set-theos.png)

Clone Theos to the directory you specified

```git clone --recursive https://github.com/theos/theos.git $THEOS```

![theos-clone](https://github.com/MTACS/TweakGuide/blob/master/images/theos-clone.png)

Next we will create a bash profile for quickly loading Theos. Open a new terminal window: 

```bash
open -a Terminal "`pwd`" 
```

Then enter the following command in order to create a bash profile:

```bash
nano ~/.bash_profile 
```

![bash-create](https://github.com/MTACS/TweakGuide/blob/master/images/bash-create.png)

Once the new window is open you will then need to create your bash profile entries:

```bash
export Path="/usr/local/sbin:$PATH"
export THEOS="~/theos"

alias c="clear"
alias tweak="$THEOS/bin/nic.pl"
alias tweaks="cd ~/Documents/Tweaks"
alias install="find . -name '.DS_Store' -type f -delete; make clean; make package install"
```
Now lets save your bash enteries:

```bash
Save the entries by pressing
Ctrl+O and then Enter

Close the editor by pressing 
Ctrl+X
```
Creating a tweak directory:

```bash
mkdir ~/Documents/Tweaks
```

Lastly, we must use patched SDK's (Software Development Kits) with Theos. This is because Apple does not include the private frameworks that are used in tweaks. These can be downloaded from the official source [here](https://github.com/theos/sdks) or via my website [here](https://mtac.app/sdks/). Places these inside the sdks folder in your theos installation directory
