# Chapter 1: Installing Theos & Configuring Your Environment

Theos is a build system to help developers make tweaks easier. It was built to work on most systems, and uses [Logos](https://iphonedevwiki.net/index.php/Logos) to make hooking iOS much easier. 

In order to write your tweaks, you must have a text editor. While most built in editors will work, a editor that is built for writing code will make your life so much easier. This tutorial will be using Visual Studio Code (VSCode), but that is totally your choice. I chose VSCode because of its support for Objective-C syntax highlighting and built in terminal window, and works on Mac, Linux and Windows. A list of popular editors are linked below

* [Atom](https://atom.io/)
* [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/3)

# Terminal

A terminal is required to build, debug and install tweaks. Despite my Mac having Terminal installed by default, I also suggest another app such as [iTerm 2](https://www.iterm2.com/). For Linux, you can find a terminal simply by searching for it in your operating system's search function. 

On Mac and Linux systems, each user has a specific file that allows for the customization of the terminal. Since I use ZSH as my shell, mine is located at ```~/.zshrc``` with the ```~``` representing my home folder ```/Users/mtac/```

I have set up some terminal shortcuts to help with the building and writing of tweaks. Below is a snippet of my ```~/.zshrc``` and I highly suggest you add them to your terminal configuration file to help with typing the same commands over and over.

```bash
alias c="clear"
alias tweak="$THEOS/bin/nic.pl"
alias tweaks="cd ~/Documents/Tweaks"
alias install="alias install="find . -name '.DS_Store' -type f -delete; make clean; make package install"
```

This way when you type the word following ```alias``` your system will run the command inside the quotation marks, saving time. Here ```c``` stands for the command ```clear``` which clears the current terminal window of all previous output, ```tweak``` displays Theos' templates for a new tweak, ```tweaks``` changes the current working directory to the folder where all your tweaks are stored, and ```install``` removes unnecessary hidden files, cleans the build and installs it to your device. Note that this is built for macOS, and ```find . -name '.DS_Store' -type f -delete``` will not work on Linux. You can use these aliases to make shortcuts to commands for anything you like!

# Installing Theos

A full detailed guide is available [here](https://github.com/theos/theos/wiki/Installation) from the official Theos GitHub page. I will go over an installation on macOS here however.

There are a few requirements that you must install before using Theos to build tweaks. First install [Xcode](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12) from the Mac AppStore. Once this is installed, run the following code inside your terminal to install the required Command Line Tools

```xcode-select --install``
