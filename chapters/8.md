# Chapter 8: Building & Packaging

Now that our tweak is written, it's time to package it. To do this, open a terminal and ```cd``` to your tweak folder. If using VSCode, you can run it from the integrated shell by pressing ```âŒ˜ + ` ``` or ```CTRL + ` ```. Now type ```make do``` followed by Enter. This will build your tweak and put the completed .deb inside the packages folder in your tweak directory.
