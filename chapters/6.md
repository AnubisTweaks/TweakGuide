# Chapter 6: Writing code

Here is where we will start writing the actual code for our tweak. It is important to start small, it is the easiest way to learn and can be used to build more complicated tweaks once you get the hang of Objective-C and Theos. When creating a tweak, think of something you want to change. For our test tweak, we will start by making a popup that displays a message when the phone is unlocked. 

I have mentioned the idea of classes a few times before. A class acts like a template, and can have properties that can be modified without affecting its parent class. In Objective-C and iOS, a class followed by a ```: OtherClass``` means its properties are inherited from ```OtherClass```. iOS uses the framework **UIKit** for all of the views displayed on the screen. This means that the base class ```UIView``` is the parent of most views. We can assume that any class that begins with UI is inherited from UIView and we can use its methods and properties without declaring them ourselves. 

```objective-c
@interface UIView
- (void)setBackgroundColor:(UIColor *)backgroundColor;
@end

@interface OurClass: UIView
@end
```

Here we can see that the class OurClass is inherited from UIView. This means that the method ```- (void)setBackgroundColor:(UIColor *)backgroundColor;``` can be used by our class automatically.
