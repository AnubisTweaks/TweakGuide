# Chapter 4: Control files

Next we will edit our ```control``` file. This is the file that your package manager, and dpkg reads to show information about your Tweak. Edit this however you like, I always change the description and version. I like to use version numbers starting from 1.0.0, but this is totally your choice. This is what you will edit when upgrading a package.

```
Package: com.mtac.testtweak
Name: testtweak
Depends: mobilesubstrate
Version: 0.0.1
Architecture: iphoneos-arm
Description: An awesome MobileSubstrate tweak!
Maintainer: MTAC

```

This is what our control file looks like for testtweak

```

Version: 1.0.0
Architecture: iphoneos-arm
