# Chapter 4: Control files

Next we will edit our ```control``` file. This is the file that your package manager, and dpkg reads to show information about your Tweak. Edit this however you like, I always change the description and version. I like to use version numbers starting from 1.0.0, but this is totally your choice. This is what you will edit when upgrading a package.

```
Package: com.mtac.testtweak
Name: testtweak
Depends: mobilesubstrate
Version: 0.0.1
Architecture: iphoneos-arm
Description: An awesome MobileSubstrate tweak!
Maintainer: MTAC
Author: MTAC
Section: Tweaks
```

This is what our control file looks like for testtweak

```
Package: com.mtac.testtweak
Name: Test Tweak
Depends: mobilesubstrate
Version: 1.0.0
Architecture: iphoneos-arm
Description: A test tweak for TweakGuide
Maintainer: MTAC
Author: MTAC
Section: Tweaks
```

**Package:** is the identifier for the tweak that we created in [Chapter 2](https://github.com/MTACS/TweakGuide/blob/master/chapters/2.md). 

**Name:** is where you can rename your tweak. This is what will be shown in your package manager, and on a repo.

**Depends:** is where you specify the packages that are required to be installed alongside your tweak in order for it to work properly. Here it says mobilesubstrate, which is the identifier for Mobile Substrate, the subsystem that all tweaks rely on.

**Version:** As explained above, this doesn't really matter as long as you keep it consistent when updating your tweak: ```1.0.0 -> 1.0.1```

**Architecture:** Leave this how it is

**Description:** Change this to a description of your tweak. It is not necessary to change this, but it is a pet peeve of mine when a tweak does not describe what it does when viewing it from a package manager.

**Maintainer:** This should be set to the name we set in [Chapter 2](https://github.com/MTACS/TweakGuide/blob/master/chapters/2.md).

**Author:** Also set in Chapter 2, this is what will be displayed as the author of the tweak

**Section:** This can be changed to better organize where your tweak is located on a repo. Some common ones used are: Tweaks, Utilities, System, or Development. We can leave this as Tweaks for now.
