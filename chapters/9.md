# Chapter 9: Preference Bundles

If your tweak has many options, you might want to add a preference bundle. This will allow you full control over options, styles and anything you might want to change with your tweak. To add a preference bundle, open VSCode to your testtweak folder. Next, in the integrated terminal ```âŒ˜ + ` ``` or ```CTRL + ` ``` and type tweak (this is the shortcut set up in [Chapter 1](https://github.com/MTACS/TweakGuide/blob/master/chapters/1.md)) and choose ```iphone/preference_bundle_modern```. Give this a name that is easy to remember, and is related to your tweak, I will choose testtweakprefs. Follow the steps which are almost identical to when making a tweak. Give it a bundle identifier, but make sure to use something you'll remember as the preferences we will use this as our prefs suite. When you get to the step where it asks for ```[iphone/preference_bundle_modern] Class name prefix (three or more characters unique to this project) [XXX]:``` choose anything you'd like as we'll be changing this later.

Your tweak folder layout should look similar to this.

Rename your xxxRootListController.m and xxxRootListController.h files to something related to the tweak. I will use TestTweakListController. Make sure it is not named something simple like PreferencesListController, as PreferenceLoader might load another preference bundle when you click on your tweak. 

Inside TestTweakListController.m, rename the first line to the name of the ```.h``` file you just renamed. This ```#import``` just tells the compiler to look for an included header file. Now where it says ```@implementation xxxRootListController```, rename this to the same as before. 

TestTweakListController.h should look like this

![prefs-header-file](https://github.com/MTACS/TweakGuide/blob/master/images/prefs-header-file.png)

TestTweakListController.m should look like this

![prefs-main-file](https://github.com/MTACS/TweakGuide/blob/master/images/prefs-main-file.png)

In order for a tweak's preference pane to be loaded in Settings, it loads a .plist file for the tweak from ```/Library/PreferenceLoader/Preferences/```. For our tweak, this is the entry.plist file inside the testtweakprefs folder. Change the value for the key detail, from the current to ```TestTweakListController```. This must be exactly the same as your .m file or the bundle will not load.

```property-list
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
	<key>entry</key>
	<dict>
		<key>bundle</key>
		<string>testtweakprefs</string>
		<key>cell</key>
		<string>PSLinkCell</string>
		<key>detail</key>
		<string>TestTweakListController</string> <!--This must match main *.m file-->
		<key>icon</key>
		<string>icon.png</string>
		<key>isController</key>
		<true/>
		<key>label</key>
		<string>testtweakprefs</string>
	</dict>
</dict>
</plist>
```

Next, inside the .m file again, there is an NSArray being return with the specifiers ```- (NSArray *)specifiers;```. This is loaded from the root file, and appears first when the section is opened in Settings. ```[self loadSpecifiersFromPlistName:@"Root" target:self];``` is self explanatory, and loads the specifiers as an array from Root.plist.
