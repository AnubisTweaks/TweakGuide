# Chapter 9: Preference Bundles

If your tweak has many options, you might want to add a preference bundle. This will allow you full control over options, styles and anything you might want to change with your tweak. To add a preference bundle, open VSCode to your testtweak folder. Next, in the integrated terminal ```âŒ˜ + ` ``` or ```CTRL + ` ``` and type tweak (this is the shortcut set up in [Chapter 1](https://github.com/MTACS/TweakGuide/blob/master/chapters/1.md)) and choose ```iphone/preference_bundle_modern```. Give this a name that is easy to remember, and is related to your tweak, I will choose testtweakprefs. Follow the steps which are almost identical to when making a tweak. Give it a bundle identifier, but make sure to use something you'll remember as the preferences we will use this as our prefs suite. When you get to the step where it asks for ```[iphone/preference_bundle_modern] Class name prefix (three or more characters unique to this project) [XXX]:``` choose anything you'd like as we'll be changing this later.

For this tutorial, I will be using the Cephei framework to make our settings better. While there are other options for preferences without Cephei I use it in my tweaks for simplicity sake, as it is much easier to register and use preference variables and it works with sandboxed apps (good for a tweak that affects multiple facets of iOS, SpringBoard & apps). To get started with Cephei, we need to make a few changes to our files. 

Your tweak folder layout should look similar to this.

Rename your xxxRootListController.m and xxxRootListController.h files to something related to the tweak. I will use TestTweakListController. Make sure it is not named something simple like PreferencesListController, as PreferenceLoader might load another preference bundle when you click on your tweak. 

Inside TestTweakListController.m, rename the first line to the name of the ```.h``` file you just renamed. This ```#import``` just tells the compiler to look for an included header file. Now where it says ```@implementation xxxRootListController```, rename this to the same as before.
