# Chapter 9: Preference Bundles

If your tweak has many options, you might want to add a preference bundle. This will allow you full control over options, styles and anything you might want to change with your tweak. To add a preference bundle, open VSCode to your testtweak folder. Next, in the integrated terminal ```âŒ˜ + ` ``` or ```CTRL + ` ``` and type tweak (this is the shortcut set up in [Chapter 1](https://github.com/MTACS/TweakGuide/blob/master/chapters/1.md)) and choose ```iphone/preference_bundle_modern```. Give this a name that is easy to remember, and is related to your tweak, I will choose testtweakprefs.
