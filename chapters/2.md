# Chapter 2: Creating your first tweak

Remember when we set up the aliases in our Terminal file for easier use? If you installed Theos to a different directory other than ```~/theos``` go back and change it to that. If everything is set up correctly, run the command ```tweaks``` to change to the folder where you will store your tweaks, then run ```tweak``` in Terminal, which should make an interface like this appear.

I will cover most of the options shown, but for now type the number corresponding to ```iphone/tweak``` for me it is 10. Enter a name for your tweak. I will be using the name testtweak to keep it simple for this tutorial

Enter a bundle identifier for your tweak. This part is important to remember as they should remain consistent and should be all lower case. I always use ```com.mtac.packagename``` for all my tweaks. For example my tweak Lynx uses the identifier ```com.mtac.lynx```.

Enter the name you want to appear as the author, obviously for me it is MTAC
