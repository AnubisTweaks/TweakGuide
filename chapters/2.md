# Chapter 2: Creating your first tweak

Remember when we set up the aliases in our Terminal file for easier use? If you installed Theos to a different directory other than ```~/theos``` go back and change it to that. If everything is set up correctly, run the command ```tweaks``` to change to the folder where you will store your tweaks, then run ```tweak``` in Terminal, which should make an interface like this appear.

I will cover most of the options shown, but for now type the number corresponding to ```iphone/tweak``` for me it is 10.
