# Chapter 2: Creating your first tweak

Remember when we set up the aliases in our Terminal file for easier use? If you installed Theos to a different directory other than ```~/theos``` go back and change it to that. If everything is set up correctly, run the command ```tweaks``` to change to the folder where you will store your tweaks, then run ```tweak``` in Terminal, which should make an interface like this appear.

I will cover most of the options shown, but for now type the number corresponding to ```iphone/tweak``` for me it is 10. Enter a name for your tweak. I will be using the name testtweak to keep it simple for this tutorial

![tweak-name](https://github.com/MTACS/TweakGuide/blob/master/images/tweak-name.png)

Enter a bundle identifier for your tweak. This part is important to remember as they should remain consistent and should be all lower case. I always use ```com.mtac.packagename``` for all my tweaks. For example my tweak Lynx uses the identifier ```com.mtac.lynx```.

Enter the name you want to appear as the author, obviously for me it is MTAC

This next step is important. Where it asks ```[iphone/tweak] MobileSubstrate Bundle filter [com.apple.springboard]:``` enter the bundle identifier of the app you want to hook. Here we just hit enter to leave it as the default, which is SpringBoard (com.apple.springboard). You should be very careful when setting this, if you only want to change one app, make sure this is set to the bundle identifier of it, otherwise issues can arise. We will go deeper into filtering and why it is important, especially when making system wide tweaks as explained [here](https://github/com/MTACS/TweakGuide).

For ```[iphone/tweak] List of applications to terminate upon installation (space-separated, '-' for none) [SpringBoard]:``` again hit enter to set it to the default of SpringBoard. This is what Theos kills when the tweak is installed. This will be explained later on.

Open the folder where your tweak was created and you should see this
