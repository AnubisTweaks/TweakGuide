# Chapter 7: Using MSHookIvar

MSHookIvar is a function included in Cydia Substrate that allows developers to hook a class' instance variable and make changes to it. This is what will allow us to modify our Dock background by itself. An example of MSHookIvar from the iPhone Dev Wiki shows what syntax to use

```c
type ivar = MSHookIvar<type>(object, ivar_name);
```

In our test tweak, add the following to grab the Dock's ivar for the background view. The first ```UIView *bgView``` is regular Objective-C syntax for creating a new variable. ```MSHookIvar<>();``` is the hooking function. Inside the ```<>``` we add our variable type again, followed by a ```*```. Inside the parenthesis, ```self``` is the class that contains the ivar. Self simply points to the class were hooking, but can be used with other classes such as ivars themselves. The name of the ivar goes inside the ```""```. Notice that there is no ```@``` before the name, this is C syntax and not Objective-C. Add the following to your code.

Now that we have our new hook UIView, we can make changes to this however we like. For our test tweak, let's hide the Dock. This is as simple as adding ```bgView.hidden = YES;```
