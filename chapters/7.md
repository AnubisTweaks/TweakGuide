# Chapter 7: Using MSHookIvar

MSHookIvar is a function included in Cydia Substrate that allows developers to hook a class' instance variable and make changes to it. This is what will allow us to modify our Dock background by itself. An example of MSHookIvar from the iPhone Dev Wiki shows what syntax to use

```c
type ivar = MSHookIvar<type>(object, ivar_name);
```

In our test tweak, add the following to grab the Dock's ivar for the background view

Now that we have our new hook UIView, we can make changes to this however we like. For our test tweak, let's hide the Dock. This is as simple as adding ```bgView.hidden = YES;```
