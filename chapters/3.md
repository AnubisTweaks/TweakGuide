# Chapter 3: Editing your tweak

Let's get your tweak opened in a text editor, and set everything up before we go into the workings of Logos and Objective-C. Below I am opening the folder in VSCode using ```CMD + O```. It should look something like this.

The latest versions of Theos create a file called Tweak.x, but I prefer to rename it to Tweak.xm so I can use MobileSubstrate functions such as ```MSHookIvar```, which is a powerful way of modifying iOS and will be explained in great detail later on. 

Tweak.xm is the main file that you will be editing. This is where all the code for tweak is placed. In order for your tweak to build however, there are a few more steps that must be taken. Open your Makefile in the editor, and change it following the code below.

### Before

```
INSTALL_TARGET_PROCESSES = SpringBoard

include $(THEOS)/makefiles/common.mk

TWEAK_NAME = testtweak

testtweak_FILES = Tweak.x
testtweak_CFLAGS = -fobjc-arc

include $(THEOS_MAKE_PATH)/tweak.mk
```

### After

```
ARCHS = arm64 arm64e

include $(THEOS)/makefiles/common.mk

TWEAK_NAME = testtweak

testtweak_FILES = Tweak.xm
testtweak_CFLAGS = -fobjc-arc

include $(THEOS_MAKE_PATH)/tweak.mk

after-install::
	install.exec "sbreload"
```

I like to remove the ```INSTALL_TARGET_PROCESSES = SpringBoard``` from my Makefiles as I use an older method that allows for more customization. This is why we add ```after-install::
	install.exec "sbreload"```
