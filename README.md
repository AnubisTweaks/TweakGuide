# TweakGuide

This was created to help with the frequent Reddit posts asking how to get into developing iOS tweaks. A common misconception is that a full knowledge of Objective-C is needed to create tweaks. Whether you have any programming experience or not, I will try to step through the process from zero knowledge to creating your first tweak. I have decided to break this into chapters, from installing a text editor, to building a full tweak to be uploaded to a repo.
