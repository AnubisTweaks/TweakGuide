# TweakGuide

This guide was created to help with the frequent Reddit posts asking how to get into developing iOS tweaks. A common misconception is that a full knowledge of Objective-C is needed to create tweaks. Whether you have any programming experience or not, I will try to step through the process from zero knowledge to creating your first tweak. I have decided to break this into chapters, from installing a text editor, to building a full tweak to be uploaded to a repo. This guide will be updated to add new topics, and is assuming you are using a computer to write tweaks, although the methods should work for writing tweaks on iOS. This is focused on Mac and Linux installations, if you are using Windows I suggest using [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) (Windows Subsystem for Linux)

## Requirements

* A text editor
* A Theos installation
* A jailbroken iOS device
